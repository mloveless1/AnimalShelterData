Dash Framework Dashboard pulling data from MongoDB(PyMongo)


How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The best way to make programs that are maintainable, readable and adaptable is to adhere to best practices. These practices can vary depending on the company you are working for. But, being consistent with that coding style and leaving comments to explain code can be crucial in writing good code with the aforementioned qualities. Knowing when to make something less complicated and even sometimes less modular can help as well. There needs to be a good balance between making some code it's own function or methods and others shouldn't be. At times, performance can be traded for maintainability, ease-of-use and readability if the performance enhancements do not make a major difference. The CRUD module can be used for a lot of things. Most apps use the MVC or MVP framework and use CRUD functionality to manipulate data from a database and display it to the user. So, the possibilities are endless.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

To keep it simple, you follow the requirements that are outlined by the customer or user as closely as possible. Another technique is to break every requirement or problem down into smaller pieces and try to "solve" each piece of the puzzle.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Solve problems. We break problems down and use algorithms - a series of steps - to come up with a solution to the problem or challenge. Software solves so many problems in modern society's daily function that it is hard to come up with a single example.
